Before submitting your Zendesk ticket, please review the developer documentation on our website. Often the answers we will provide can be found there. 
When submitting a Zendesk ticket, particularly in cases when you are encountering an error, you can minimize your time to resolve the issue by providing the following information:

 * Link to your portal configuration
 * Screenshots of all error messages
 * What browser you were using
 * Time the error(s) occurred or if it is ongoing
 * Any relevant information recorded in your server logs

It is also **highly recommended** to include someone we can contact from your technical team when creating the Zendesk ticket in case we have further questions about how your application was configured.
