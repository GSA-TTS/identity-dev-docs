There are some cases where our team is unable to help, typically either for security or capacity reasons. We cannot assist with the following issues:

* Setting up your integration for you (while we can provide additional tips and guidelines, we do not have the bandwidth nor access to your internal tools to provide this service)
* Deleting, creating, or managing a user account (only the user themselves can access their account) 
* Specific programming language help (given the numerous different languages our partners use it is not possible for us to provide peer programming assistance)
* Requests for network IP addresses (we use Cloudfront to manage our IP, so our IP addresses are not static)
* Debugging network connection issues (if the connection isn’t going through, we cannot see it on our end and thus have very limited ability to troubleshoot) 
* Any kind of PII request (we do not give out PII for any reason) 
* Debugging your internal server setup (we can try to direct you to documentation but our server knowledge is limited) 
* Providing access to the portal (for security purposes, the portal is self service and anyone with a .gov / .mil address can provide access - [View Product Deployment for further instructions](https://developers.login.gov/production/#before-deployment))
* You’ve found a vulnerability and want to report it (Instead, please submit through [Login.gov Security Vulnerability Disclosure](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScuo4xCzBlpLnoq7-bDAVAxtJci03by7S-Q-Z_JUBDloK01QA/viewform))
