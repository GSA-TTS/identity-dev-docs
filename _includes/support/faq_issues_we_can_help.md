Here is a list of common issues partners encounter that our team can assist with. This isnâ€™t a comprehensive list but questions that fall into these categories can usually be answered. 

* Authentication failures while testing in sandbox environment
* Questions about OIDC/SAML protocols
* Problems with portal configuration (configuration not updating as expected)
* Invalid PIV/CAC certificate errors (we may need to update certs on our end)
* Problems updating or deploying a production configuration
* Clarification about something in our developer docs
* Any errors being returned by Login.gov during authentication
* Suspected fraudulent activity / RISC notifications 
* Troubles with redirecting back to your application / Service Provider
* Trouble reading or receiving expected user attributes 
* Users being unable to sign into production Service Provider (these are top priority to resolve, assuming it is related to Login.gov) 
* Feedback you want to share about your experience using the developer docs / portal (we are always looking to improve)
* Any bugs you encounter in the portal or developer docs (broken links, user management issues, etc)
