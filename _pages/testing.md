## Using the dashboard

Login.gov provides an open sandbox environment to create and test integrations between login.gov and your applications. In the sandbox environment, we provide a dashboard where you can manage your test applications.

## How to get started

Anybody with an email address ending in .gov or .mil can create an account in the sandbox environment. If you are a government contractor, ask your agency partner to help you gain access.

1. Visit the dashboard at [https://dashboard.int.identitysandbox.gov](https://dashboard.int.identitysandbox.gov). In the upper-right corner, click **Log in**. You'll be prompted to sign in or create an account with the test login.gov IdP in the agency integration environment (hosted at [idp.int.identitysandbox.gov](https://idp.int.identitysandbox.gov)). **Please note that if you already have a login.gov account that this is a test environment that is not linked to your production account.**
2. Once you are logged into your sandbox account, you'll be asked to create a team and add users to that team.
3. After creating your team, go to the Apps tab. This page is where you will find all of the test applications you and your team will create.
4. Click **Create a new test app** and fill out the form to register a new application with the login.gov IdP in the test sandbox environment.
5. Start testing! If you need to troubleshoot, please [send us an email](mailto:partners@login.gov) and we can onboard you to our partner support Slack channel and the login.gov team will help you along the way.
6. When you're ready to go to production, please contact our team at [partners@login.gov](mailto:partners@login.gov) and notify us. We'll manage your application's promotion to production.

## Testing IAL2

IAL2 testing requires a driver's license.  To override this behavior for testing purposes you can upload a text file with a .txt extension in place of front and back images with the following format:

```
document:
  type: license
  first_name: Susan
  last_name: Smith
  middle_name: Q
  address1: 1 Microsoft Way
  address2: Apt 3
  city: Bayside
  state: NY
  zipcode: '11364'
  dob: 10/06/1938
  phone: +1 314-555-1212
