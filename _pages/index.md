# Get started...

- [Understand our flow]({{ site.baseurl }}/overview/).
- Determine your application needs, like the level of proofing and [user attributes]({{ site.baseurl }}/attributes/) that will be requested.
- Select between [OpenID Connect (OIDC)]({{ site.baseurl }}/oidc/) or [SAML protocol]({{ site.baseurl }}/saml/) implementation protocols. Please note that we recommend OIDC.
- Configure your app. We have [implementation guides]({{ site.baseurl }}/oidc/) and example apps to get you up and running quickly.
- [Register your app in the sandbox dashboard and start testing]({{ site.baseurl }}/testing/).
- Let us know when you are ready to go live and our [partners@login.gov](mailto:partners@login.gov) will help you promote the application to production. We will check you against our production checklist to ensure your application is good to go to production from an administrative and technical standpoint.
- Be sure to read the [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/faq/) for answers to the most common questions.
