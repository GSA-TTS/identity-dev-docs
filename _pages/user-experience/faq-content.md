## Add FAQ content to inform users about Login.gov (Optional)

When you first integrate with Login.gov, we recommend adding frequently asked questions (FAQ) content to ensure that users are able to understand that your application uses Login.gov as a sign-in service. The next few sections outline plain language for agencies to leverage when creating that content.

### What is Login.gov?
Login.gov is a sign in service that offers secure and private online access to government programs, such as federal benefits, services and applications. With a Login.gov account, you can sign in to multiple government websites with the same email address and password. Learn more about Login.gov.

### Why is [YOUR APPLICATION] using Login.gov?
[APPLICATION] chose Login.gov as their sign-in provider as a security measure. This service requires you to use an email address, password and two-factor authentication, sometimes referred to as multi-factor authentication, to sign-in. The use of two-factor authentication is an added layer of security to protect your private and sensitive information from hackers and password compromises.

**[Identity Verification ONLY]** In addition to meeting the above requirements for multi-factor authentication, Login.gov asks users to upload a photograph of their state-issued ID and share their address, phone number and other personal information which is then verified against authoritative sources. Verifying your identity makes sure the right person has access to the right information. We are using Login.gov’s simple and secure process to keep your sensitive information safe.

### How do I create a Login.gov account?
Start by selecting sign-in on [APPLICATION home page or link]. You’ll automatically be taken to the Login.gov sign-in page. You can create an account or sign in if you already have a Login.gov account. Login.gov is only the sign-in service. Once you sign in, you’ll be directed to your [APPLICATION] account or profile.

Login.gov requires you to use a multifactor authentication method. You can select to receive a code via SMS/Text or phone call or use an authentication application, government PIV/CAC card, face or touch unlock, security key or download backup codes. We encourage you to add more than one authentication method to your account to avoid getting locked out if you ever lose an authentication method. <a

### How do I sign in to [APPLICATION] after I create my Login.gov account?
Every time you click on Sign In on the APPLICATION site, you’ll go to the Login.gov sign in page. Enter your Login.gov email address, password and use your two-factor authentication method. Once you enter this information correctly, you’ll be signed in and automatically directed back to the APPLICATION site.

### Can I use my existing [APPLICATION] username and password to sign in?
No. Your old username and password will no longer work. You must create a new account or use your existing Login.gov account to sign in. We’ll connect your new Login.gov account with your existing [APPLICATION] profile during the process.

### What if I already have a Login.gov account?
If you already have a Login.gov account, you don’t need to create a second one. Use your existing Login.gov email address, password and a two-factor authentication method to sign in to [APPLICATION].

### What email address do I use to create a Login.gov account?
If you don’t have an [APPLICATION] profile, we recommend you use a personal email address that you control. We recommend you don’t use a work email address. Why? If you leave your job, you’ll no longer have access to that email address. Without access to that email address, it will be much harder to verify who you are, if you ever need to reset your password. You also can’t use an email address you share with someone else.

### Can I share a Login.gov account with another person?
No. Each person must set up their own Login.gov account, with their own personal email address (not an email that you share with someone else).

### Where do I get support for my Login.gov account?
Login.gov can only help you resolve issues around signing in. For example, you would contact Login.gov if you have questions about your password or two-factor authentication method.

Please keep in mind Login.gov cannot reset, delete or access your account on your behalf if you are locked out. You’ll need to delete your account and start again.

We encourage you to add more than one two-factor authentication method and to keep your username and password in a safe place.  <a

### Can Login.gov help me with my [APPLICATION] benefits, services, application or profile?
No. You still need to contact [AGENCY] for questions about your [APPLICATION] benefits, services, application or profile. [IF APPLICABLE] Our customer support can be reached [info].
