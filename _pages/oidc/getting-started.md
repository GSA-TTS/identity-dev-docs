title: OpenID Connect
lead: >
   [OpenID Connect](http://openid.net){:class="usa-link--external"} is a simple identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. Login.gov supports [version 1.0](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html){:class="usa-link--external"} of the specification and conforms to the [iGov Profile](https://openid.net/wg/igov){:class="usa-link--external"}.

We do not support the OpenID Connect “implicit flow” with client_secret because it is not recommended by the OAuth group for security reasons

## Getting started

### Choosing an authentication method

Login.gov supports two ways of authenticating clients: **private_key_jwt** and **PKCE**.

- **private_key_jwt** (preferred for web apps)
  The client sends a [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/){:class="usa-link--external"}, or JWT, signed with a private key (minimum length of 2048 bits) when requesting access tokens. The corresponding public key is registered with the IdP ahead of time, similar to SAML.

- **PKCE** (preferred for native mobile apps)
  Short for [Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636){:class="usa-link--external"} and pronounced "pixy." In this method, the client sends a public identifier as well as a hashed random value generated by the client.

### Unsupported methods

The following implementation methods of OIDC are not supported by Login.gov for security reasons. 

- **Implicit flow** is [not recommended by the OAuth group](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/implicit/){:class="usa-link--external"}.
- **client_secret_param** is not supported because it requires managing a shared secret in two places, both the client and the server. Private_key_jwt flow involves sharing public keys with the server and PKCE has a one-time secret.

### Set up a Sandbox account

You are able to test authentication methods in real time with a testing account in our sandbox environment. To start, navigate to the [Login Partner Dashboard Sandbox](https://dashboard.int.identitysandbox.gov) and follow the steps below:

- Select the “Sign-in” button to create a new account. Anyone with a .gov or .mil email address may request an account. 
- Create a new team - see [Testing](https://developers.login.gov/testing/) page for instructions
-  Create a certificate - before creating your application you'll need to create a certificate that will be used to sign your requests. You can create a certificate using openssl. The example command to create the certificate from your terminal is:
    - `openssl req -nodes -x509 -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private.pem -out public.crt`
- Create an application, at which point you will need to decide between private_key_jwt or PKCE

It is important to note that your Login.gov production account and your Login.gov sandbox account are two separate accounts.

### Auto-discovery

Consistent with the specification, Login.gov provides a JSON endpoint for OpenID Connect auto-discovery at 
`/.well-known/openid-configuration`. 

Integration URI:
- [https://idp.int.identitysandbox.gov/.well-known/openid-configuration](https://idp.int.identitysandbox.gov/.well-known/openid-configuration)

Production URI:
- [https://secure.login.gov/.well-known/openid-configuration](https://secure.login.gov/.well-known/openid-configuration)

### Example Application

The Login.gov team has created an example client to speed up your development, all open source in the public domain: [identity-oidc-sinatra](https://github.com/18F/identity-oidc-sinatra){:class="usa-link--external"}.
