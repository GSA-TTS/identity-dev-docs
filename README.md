## Temporary Alert

To add a temporary alert to the developer docs set the `temporary_alert` configuration value in `_config.yml` to a string with the desired alert contents, e.g. `The sandbox will be unavailable from <b>5:30-6:30p ET on Tuesday, August 9th</b>.`. To turn off the alert change the configuration value to `false`.

## Development

### Docker

Build and run the site

```sh
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
open http://localhost:4000
```

Some changes, like `_config.yml` don't get picked up automatically in Docker. You can pick up these changes by stopping/starting the cluster.

Run tests

```sh
docker-compose run web make test
```

You can drop into a bash shell in the container with

```sh
docker-compose run web bash
```

### Locally

Run initial setup:

```sh
make setup
```

Run the server locally:

```sh
make run
```

Run the tests:

```sh
make test
```
