## Development

### Docker

Build and run the site

```sh
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
open http://localhost:4000
```

Some changes, like `_config.yml` don't get picked up automatically in Docker. You can pick up these changes by stopping/starting the cluster.

Run tests

```sh
docker-compose run web make test
```

You can drop into a bash shell in the container with 

```sh
docker-compose run web bash
```

### Locally

Run the server locally: 

```sh
make run
```

Run the tests:

```sh
make test
```
