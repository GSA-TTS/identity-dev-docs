## Temporary Alert

To add a temporary alert to the developer docs set the `temporary_alert` configuration value in `_config.yml` to a string with the desired alert contents, e.g. `The sandbox will be unavailable from <b>5:30-6:30p ET on Tuesday, August 9th</b>.`. To turn off the alert change the configuration value to `false`.

## Development

```sh

This site uses the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov). To update them:

1. Download the [latest release](https://standards.usa.gov/download)
2. Copy contents to `assets/`
3. Rename directory to `uswds`
4. Download latest [anchor.js](https://github.com/bryanbraun/anchorjs) and put in `assets/js/`

#### YAML files

When updating a `yml` file, you only need to update the version in the `/assets` directory. This is symlinked to the `_includes` directory.
